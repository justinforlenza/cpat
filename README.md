The Career Pathways Automation Tool is a powerfull solution developed to address the inherent inefficiencies of the existing Career Pathways Portal website.

Recognizing the limitations and time-consuming processes of the portal, this program aims to streamline tasks and optimize user productivity.

The Career Pathways Portal Automation Program aims to address these inefficiencies by automating many repetitive tasks.

This tool was developed out of passion (and a little frustration) to meet a specific set of needs.
It may fit your needs, it may not. Use at your own discretion and be sure to test before using at large scale.
